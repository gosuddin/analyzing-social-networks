Analyzing and drawing inferences on interesting social networks

The repository contains few of the problem sets required for the completion of the course - INFX 576 taught by our amazing professor Dr. Emma Stuart Spiro at University of Washington.

All of the social networks are analysed based on various Node-Level Indices and Graph-Level Indices. This repository also consists of numerous interesting network visualizations.

Several topics taught in the class are not covered in this repository, such as Hubert's QAP test, Small World Phenomenon, Preferential Attachements, etc.
